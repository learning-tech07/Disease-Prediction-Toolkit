🩺 Disease Prediction Toolkit
📌 Overview

The Disease Prediction Toolkit is a machine learning project designed to predict heart disease based on patient health attributes.
The model is trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset (via Kaggle) using classification algorithms, providing predictions that can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python (Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook) and leverages popular ML libraries for training, evaluation, and visualization.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning for clinical datasets

Handling missing values (mean imputation for numerics)

Encoding categorical variables

Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

Exporting trained models for reuse

Interactive visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, etc.)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy, Pandas → Data handling

Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization

Joblib → Model persistence (optional)
